# Title
Project Tracker App

## Project Idea
A simple web app that lets users create, modify and delete projects. A project consists of a description, an optional github_url, a status (pending, processing, failure, done), and an optional comment field. Everyone can see a list of projects and filter by the status. Also, everyone can search the list for a string in the project description. Only the creator of the project can update, delete a project.
